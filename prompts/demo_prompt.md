## L1: System-Level Requirements

### Problem Statement
**L1.01**
```
Build an AI-powered code review assistant that analyzes pull requests,
identifies potential bugs, security issues, and style violations,
and provides actionable feedback to developers.
```

### User Persona
**L1.02**
```
Software developers on a mid-size engineering team (20-50 people).
They're experienced with Git and GitHub, work in Python/TypeScript,
and review 5-10 PRs per week. They want faster, more consistent reviews.
```

### System Integration
**L1.03**

```

### Timeline Constraint
**L1.05**
```
MVP by end of Q1 2025, full launch Q2 2025
```

### Budget Constraint
**L1.06**
```
$15,000 development budget, $500/month hosting
```

### Concurrency Scale
**L1.07**
```
50 developers now, 200 in a year
```

### Platform Target
**L1.08**
```
Web browser, CLI tool
```

### Speed vs Robustness Trade-off
**L1.09**
```
Balanced
```
