# GAADP TOPOLOGY CONFIGURATION
# Execution topology and tool permissions for GenericAgent

topology_type: "graph_first"

# Parallel execution limits (enforced by GraphRuntime)
parallel_limits:
  max_concurrent_agents: 10
  max_iterations: 100

# Verification requirements
verification_requirements:
  strict_gating: true
  minimum_verifiers_per_node: 1

# Timeouts

# Role-Based Access Control for MCP Tools
# These permissions are loaded by GenericAgent from agent_manifest.yaml
tool_permissions:
  # The Architect designs; needs read-only access + web search
  ARCHITECT:
    allowed_servers: ["filesystem", "internet"]
    allowed_tools: ["read_file", "list_directory", "fetch_url", "search_web"]
    context_radius: 3

  # The Builder constructs; needs write access
  BUILDER:
    allowed_servers: ["filesystem"]
    allowed_tools: ["read_file", "write_file", "list_directory"]
    context_radius: 1

  # The Verifier audits; needs read-only access
  VERIFIER:
    allowed_servers: ["filesystem"]
    allowed_tools: ["read_file", "list_directory"]
    context_radius: 2

# Note: Governance roles (TREASURER, SENTINEL, CURATOR, etc.) have been removed.
# Their functionality is now embedded in:
# - NodeMetadata (cost_limit, security_level, max_attempts)
# - TransitionMatrix (state transition rules)
# - GraphRuntime (condition evaluation)
