Level	ID	Ask_When	Category	Question (Plain Language)	Technical Name	Notes
L1	L1.01	Always	Problem	What is the single most important problem this software solves for you?	(Problem Statement)	The prompt itself - establishes North Star
L1	L1.02	Always	Users	Who exactly will use this? Describe the person at the keyboard.	(User Persona)	Critical for UX decisions
L1	L1.03	Always	Integration	Does this need to connect to any existing systems you already use?	(System Integration)	Zero inference - only user knows their stack
L1	L1.04	Always	Compliance	Are there legal or industry rules we must follow? (e.g., health privacy, European data laws, credit card handling)	(Regulatory Compliance)	HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS - must be explicit
L1	L1.05	Always	Timeline	Is there a hard deadline we need to hit?	(Timeline Constraint)	Zero inference - external reality
L1	L1.06	Always	Budget	Is there a budget limit for building or running this?	(Budget Constraint)	Zero inference - external reality
L1	L1.07	Always	Scale	How many people will use this at once? Now and in a year?	(Concurrency Scale)	Drives architecture decisions
L1	L1.08	Always	Platform	Where will people use this? (Web browser, phone app, desktop software, or multiple?)	(Platform Target)	Drives technology stack
L1	L1.09	Always	Trade-off	If you had to choose: get something working fast, or build it to last?	(Speed vs Robustness)	MVP vs production-grade - user must decide
L2	L2.01	Always	Boundary	What kicks off this feature, and what means it's finished?	(Trigger and Exit Condition)	Defines module boundaries - consolidated from L2.02 + L2.03
L2	L2.02	Always	Data Flow	Does this handle one thing at a time, batches, or a continuous stream? Does the user wait for results or can it run in background?	(Cardinality and Latency)	Consolidated from L2.07 + L2.08 + L2.09
L2	L2.03	Always	Topology	What does this feature need from other parts, and what does it provide to them?	(Dependencies and Dependents)	Consolidated from L2.04 + L2.05 - critical for graph structure
L2	L2.04	Always	Data Ownership	Does this feature own its data, or borrow it from somewhere else?	(Data Sovereignty)	Critical topological question - determines source of truth
L2	L2.05	If_Ambiguous	Fault Handling	If this feature breaks, should the whole app stop, or just this part?	(Fault Isolation)	Usually inferable from module criticality
L3	L3.01	If_No_Graph_Structure	Interface	What data goes in and what comes out? What format and rules?	(I/O Schema)	Only ask if not derivable from function signature or parent SPEC
L3	L3.02	If_Ambiguous	Side Effects	Does this change anything permanent or external? (Database, email, payment, file)	(Side Effects and Idempotency)	Consolidated from L3.10 + L3.11 - usually obvious from function name
L3	L3.03	Structural_Validator	Data Source	Where exactly does each input come from?	(Input Provenance)	NEVER guess - graph must have explicit edge or ask user
L3	L3.04	Structural_Validator	Hidden State	Does this need any information not passed in directly?	(Implicit Dependencies)	NEVER guess - catches "magic variables"
TERMINAL	T1	Always	Assumptions	Here's what I'm assuming: [LIST]. Correct? Anything else?	(Assumptions Review)	Surfaces inferences for correction before proceeding
TERMINAL	T2	Always	Delegation	Want to skip any of these questions? I'll use my best judgment for skipped items.	(Delegation License)	User can say "skip" to delegate decision to agent
