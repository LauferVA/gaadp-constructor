PROJECT: Asteroid Game (Pygame)
TARGET DIR: game/

OBJECTIVES:
1. Create a fully playable Asteroids clone using pygame.
2. Architecture MUST be decomposed into at least 5 separate files:
   - main.py: The game loop and initialization.
   - entities.py: Base classes for GameObject.
   - player.py: Ship mechanics (thrust, rotation).
   - asteroid.py: Rock mechanics (splitting, drift).
   - physics.py: Collision detection and movement vectors.
3. Constraint: main.py is the ONLY entry point. No circular imports allowed.

GOVERNANCE:
- The Architect must define the DEPENDS_ON edges explicitly in the PLAN.
- The Verifier must fail any code that imports a file not defined in the architecture.
