The script `collatz_solver.py` must find the starting number under 1,000,000 that produces the longest Collatz sequence.\n\n## 2. The Math (The Collatz Conjecture)\nThe sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:\n* n \u2192 n/2 (n is even)\n* n \u2192 3n + 1 (n is odd)\n\nUsing the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:\n`13 -> 40 -> ",
