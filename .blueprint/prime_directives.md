# PRIME DIRECTIVES: GRAPH STATE & CONTROL PROTOCOLS
> SYSTEM_LEVEL_IMMUTABLE

## I. FLOW CONTROL
1. **Triggers**: A node is "Active" ONLY when status=`COMPLETE`. Downstream nodes activate ONLY when ALL dependencies are `COMPLETE`.
2. **Gates**: Phase `N+1` cannot begin until **100%** of nodes in Phase `N` possess valid `VERIFIED` edges.
3. **Validators**: A `CODE` Node cannot receive an `IMPLEMENTS` edge until it first possesses a `VERIFIES` edge.

## II. AGENT BEHAVIOR
4. **Certifiers**: Research loops MUST terminate upon receiving a `STOP` signal.
5. **Signatures**: Every edge created must carry the `agent_id` and `cryptographic_signature` of its creator (Generated by Runtime).
6. **Quorum**: Modifications to `SPEC` or `DIRECTIVE` nodes require **>= 2** distinct Agent signatures.

## III. SYSTEM SAFETY
7. **Monitors**: `SENTINEL` and `CURATOR` run continuously. They have `sudo` permission to pause the graph.
8. **Constraints**: Execution halts if `cost_ledger` > budget.
9. **Escalators**: User questions pause the specific subgraph; Wavefront reallocates compute.
10. **Checkpoints**: Serialize Graph State `STATE` node *before* creating `VERIFIES` edges.

## IV. INTEGRITY & CONCURRENCY
11. **Invalidators**: If a Node is modified, delete all outgoing `VERIFIES` edges from it and its dependents.
12. **Mutexes**: Agents MUST acquire a `WRITE_LOCK` on target nodes.
13. **Tombstones**: Failed branches become `DEAD_END` nodes, not deleted.
14. **Scopes**: `BUILDER` (Read-Only SPEC). `ARCHITECT` (Read-Only DIRECTIVES).

## V. CONTEXTUAL ECONOMICS
15. **Horizons**: `BUILDER` Radius=1. `VERIFIER` Radius=2. `ARCHITECT` Radius=3.
16. **Resolutions**: Inject `Interface` for neighbors, `Body` for target only.
17. **Partitions**: Context queries must filter by `domain_tag`.
